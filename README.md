# Object Detection
This project implements an object detection system using computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. It allows to identify and classify objects in images or video in real time.

# Technologies used:
- Python: Main programming language.
- OpenCV: For image processing and video manipulation.
- YOLOv11: For the implementation of the object detection model.
- Tkinter: To load the video and display the results.
